<p align="center">With this plugin, all skins become visible, as it supports new skin formats introduced since Minecraft Bedrock 1.13.0. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/presentkim-pm/PersonaSkin">presentkim for their PM3 and PM4</a> creations (give them a star), which inspired the solution for this issue. Using their work as a model, I've crafted a PocketMine 5.0 counterpart plugin.</p>

#### :question: Why did **XSkinPersona** appear?

On October 29, 2019, a new skin format was introduced in Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.13.0. Vanilla PocketMine did not support and still does not support these skin formats, simply ignoring them and filling them with random colors. **[PresentKim](https://github.com/presentkim-pm/PersonaSkin)** provided a solution to this issue in PM3 and PM4, but with the release of PM5, his method became obsolete, which inspired me to create this plugin. We must acknowledge PresentKim's credit as the original creator of this idea. Thank you!
